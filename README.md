# üöó License Plate Detection & Tracking with YOLOv8 + OCR

This project performs real-time **vehicle and license plate detection** using a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model**, tracks them using **SORT**, extracts license plate text using **EasyOCR**, and outputs **annotated videos** with **CSV logs**.
